ðŸ“¦ Parcel Bundler

This project uses Parcel as the web application bundler to simplify development and build processes. Parcel offers a zero-configuration setup, making it easy to work with modern JavaScript frameworks like React. It automatically handles tasks such as JSX and ES6 transpilation, module bundling, asset optimization, and hot module reloading during development. With Parcel, there's no need to manually configure Babel, Webpack, or other build tools â€” it just works out of the box, helping you focus on writing code.
